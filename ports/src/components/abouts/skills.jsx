              i am 21-year-old full-stack software developer, I have honed my
              skills through continuous learning and hands-on training in ICT
              coding, particularly through the Alight program. My proficiency
              spans all aspects of software development, encompassing both
              front-end and back-end development, as well as UI/UX design. I am
              adept at crafting intuitive and visually appealing user
              interfaces, leveraging tools and principles of UI/UX design to
              enhance the overall user experience. From wireframing and
              prototyping to creating responsive layouts and implementing user
              interactions, I ensure that the design aligns with both aesthetic
              and functional requirements. On the front-end, I excel in
              technologies such as JavaScript and TypeScript, utilizing
              frameworks like React.js and libraries like Redux to build dynamic
              and interactive web interfaces. My expertise extends to HTML5,
              CSS3, and preprocessors like SASS/SCSS, enabling me to create
              polished and modern web experiences. In the realm of back-end
              development, I am proficient in server-side technologies such as
              Node.js and databases like MongoDB and SQL. I design and implement
              robust APIs, manage authentication and authorization, and ensure
              data integrity and security in my applications. Furthermore, my
              understanding of cloud platforms such as AWS or Azure,
              containerization with Docker, and version control with Git
              empowers me to deploy and maintain scalable and resilient software
              solutions. With a passion for problem-solving and a commitment to
              staying updated with the latest technologies and best practices, I
              am well-equipped to tackle diverse software development challenges
              and deliver high-quality solutions that meet the needs of users
              and businesses alike.
